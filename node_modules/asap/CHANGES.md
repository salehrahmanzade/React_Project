## 2.0.6

Version 2.0.4 adds support for React Native by clarifying in package.json that
the browser environment does not support Node.js domains.
Why this is necessary, we leave as an exercise for the user.

## 2.0.3

Version 2.0.3 fixes a bug when adjusting the capacity of the task queue.

## 2.0.1-2.02

Version 2.0.1 fixes a bug in the way redirects were expressed that affected the
function of Browserify, but which Mr would tolerate.

## 2.0.0

Version 2 of ASAP is a full rewrite with a few salient changes.
First, the ASAP source is CommonJS only and designed with [Browserify][] and
[Browserify-compatible][Mr] module loaders in mind.

[Browserify]: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify
[Mr]: https://github.com/montagejs/mr

The new version has been refactored in two dimensions.
Support for Node.js and browsers have been separated, using Browserify
redirects and ASAP has been divided into two modules.
The "raw" layer depends on the tasks to catch thrown exceptions and unravel
Node.js domains.

The full implementation of ASAP is loadable as `require("asap")` in both Node.js
and browsers.

The raw layer that lacks exception handling overhead is loadable as
`require("asap/raw")`
